Electron microscopy
===================

Electron microscopy is a structural technique used to get molecular topology,
as well as high resolution electron density maps that can be used to build
atomistic models of molecular complexes. Usually, negative stain EM is done
before CryoEM in order to assess sample quality and get lower resolution
structural information.
