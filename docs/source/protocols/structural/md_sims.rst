Molecular dynamics simulations
==============================

MD simulations use physical parameters of atoms to simulate how they 
interact. There are various approaches, softwares, and forcefields to 
use for simulations. Choosing the correct set will allow you to gain 
mechanistic insight into your biomolecular system.
