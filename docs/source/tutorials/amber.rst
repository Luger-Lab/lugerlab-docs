AMBER is a suite of molecular dynamics programs that can be used to simulate
biomolecules at a variety of granularities. It is broken into two main parts.
AMBERTools, which includes the free-to-use MD engine, ``sander`` which runs on 
CPUs, as well as various analysis scripts. And AMBER, which is distributed 
through a license and includes the GPU-accelerated engine, ``pmemd``. We will
be using the ``pmemd`` version of the software.

All-atom with implicit solvent

Prepare structure
-----------------
Preparing structures with implicit solvents requires that we use the ``igb=8`` parameter
as well as remove the periodic box argument. Because we aren't using solvent, 
we also don't need to solvate the system. 

Minimization
------------
Minimization is done like explicit solvents, simply keep the above parameters in mind.

Heating
-------
Heating is done like explicit solvents, simply keep the above parameters in mind.

Equilibration
-------------
Equilibration is done like explicit solvents, simply keep the above parameters in mind.

Production
----------
Production is done like explicit solvents, simply keep the above parameters in mind.
