All atom implicit solvent
=========================

Adapted from `AMBER tutorial <https://ambermd.org/tutorials/basic/tutorial15/index.php>`_.

#. Prepare structure
Preparing structures with implicit solvents requires that we use the igb=8 parameter
as well as remove the periodic box argument. Because we aren't using solvent, 
we also don't need to solvate the system. 

#. Minimization
Minimization is done like explicit solvents, simply keep the above parameters in mind.

#. Heating
Heating is done like explicit solvents, simply keep the above parameters in mind.

#. Equilibration
Equilibration is done like explicit solvents, simply keep the above parameters in mind.

#. Production
Production is done like explicit solvents, simply keep the above parameters in mind.

#. Analysis
