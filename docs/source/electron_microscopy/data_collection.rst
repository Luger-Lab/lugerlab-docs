Learn how to use the FEI Tecnai T12 TEM to image negative stain.


Instructions for using the microscope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
0. Get trained by Garry Morgan (garry.morgan@colorado.edu)
0. Reserve time using the `online portal <https://www.colorado.edu/facility/ems/>`_
0. Log into the Windows server
0. Check liquid nitrogen dewar and top off if necessary on right hand side of column
0. Check if `High Tension` and `Filament` are on (buttons are yellow when on)
  - if not, turn them on (`High Tension` first, then `Filament`)
	- wait at least 5 min after turning on the filament to collect data
0. Gun/Col vacuum should ideally read 6
	if sample has been inserted, often goes to 12 - 14
	if higher than that = not good

Make sure the column valves are closed (button should be yellow)

Make sure the beam is spread
	open the viewing window and adjust using intensity dial
		if column valves are closed, you won't see anything
	just set the C2 value on screen ~50%

Remove the sample holder
	pull straight out, resisting vacuum, with other hand on plate
	then turn CW until it stops
	then re-grip and break seal of vacuum with thumb on plate
	then pull straight out the rest of the way, slowly

Load sample (DRY)
	Use pin to "open door"
	Use tweezers to place grid into hole
		Don't touch anything near the business end with your bare hands
	Use pin to "close door"
	Give a gentle shake to make sure grid stays in there

Insert sample holder
	Put pin at 2 o'clock
		sample will be oriented vertically
	Insert slowly until pin hits a stop
	Then gently push holder while turning CW, another 1 -2 cm
	Seal is created and red light/vacuum pump will go on
		takes 1 min
	Then rotate CCW to stop
	Vacuum will draw the holder in: guide it slowly so it doesn't go too fast

Open camera software (AMT) and move to other screen
	Make a New Case Study
		under Images on "192â€¦."
		Choose/make new folder for the days experiment

Open the column valves to let beam through the screen

Adjust mag and beam intensity and center on a feature of the grid

Alpha Wobbler adjustment
	Press L1 on left control panel
	Adjust Z-height on right control panel
		light taps on plus/minus buttons until the feature no longer moves away from the center
	Press L1 again to turn off alpha wobbler
		(Press Eucentric focus)

Adjusting beam
	once in an area of interest, adjust mag and center beam with left track ball
	also adjust intensity with dial on left control panel
		should be 4 - 5 nanoAmps


Camera
	insert camera
	then click live image
	adjust beam intensity, focus and mag as needed
		mag of 18,000 is pretty nice
	click for final image and then right click on save
		that will close the final image and re-activate the live camera
	Pro-tip: focus/mag/ adjust in one spot; then move to a new spot nearby for an "undamaged" image

FFT (as needed)
	click on xxx

Changing grids
	click camera in to move the camera back out
	lower Mag to ~1000x
	reduce intensity to ~50%
	stage xy reset
	Close column valves = the most important thing!

Leaving the 'scope
	Do the changing grids stuff
	Remove your sample from the 'scope and the sample holder
	Re-insert the empty sample holder
	log your time on the e-logger and the paper log
	transfer your images to Google Drive

	if no one else is coming soon, turn filament off
