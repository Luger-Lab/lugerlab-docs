Negative stain

Goal
~~~~
Prepare negative stain grids for TEM to assess particle quality, general topology or obtain a low-resolution dataset.

Background
~~~~~~~~~~
A complex of biological molecules (generally >50kDa) is deposited onto plasma-discharged carbon film grids. Plasma-cleaning is a means of ensuring that the surface of the carbon is uniformly hydrophilic and will allow your sample to stick to the surface of the carbon. After deposition or your biological sample onto the carbon film, uranyl acetate or formate is used to coat the rest of the film with uranium atoms. These extremely dense atoms do not allow transmission of electrons as well as your biological sample. This creates a negative staining of your sample, with great contrast between it and the uranium atoms.

Making 2.5% uranyl formate solution (enough for 4 grids)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Mass out 25mg of UF in an eppi-tube
#. Wrap in tinfoil
#. Add 1mL of boiled and cooled (to remove carboxylic acid) dH20
#. Invert to dissolve most of the UF
#. Add 2uL of KOH to the lid of the eppi-tube (adding it directly will cause precipitation of UF)
#. Invert again until the rest is dissolved
#. Filter into a new eppi-tube wrapped in tinfoil

Discharging grid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*use CF400-CU UL (or similar) grids, **do not use formvar grids***
#. Load the ``20nm carbon`` recipe on the plasma cleaner
#. Vent the chamber to open
#. Place grids in grid holder
#. Place grid holder in middle (third hole) of stage
#. Replace door and ``Run Recipe``
#. Watch for plasma discharge
#. Vent chamber to open
#. Take out grids, replace door
#. ``Pump Down`` chamber to ~30mTor
#. ``Finish Up`` to place in standby
